## Methods

### **!** operator

Returns `false`, since most objects are considered [true](control-flow.html#truth).

### **==**(other) and **!=**(other) operators

Compares two objects using built-in equality. This compares numbers by value,
and all other objects are compared by identity&mdash;two objects are equal only
if they are the exact same object.

### **toString**

A default string representation of the object.

### **type**

The [Class](#class-class) of the object.
